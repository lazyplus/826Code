%The basic idea of inference problem is to get something interesting based on 
%the observation and some probability constrains.
%For example, given the constrains on the original code and the noisy channel's property, how can we get the original code from the received corrupted code.

\subsection{Belief Propagation}
Based on the pairwise MRF graph, there is a message passing algorithm, called Belief Propagation\cite{Yedidia:2003:UBP} to compute the marginal possibility of unknown nodes.

The messages are defined as $m_{ij}(x_j)$, which is the chance that node j is in state $x_j$ in node i's opinion.

Given node i is in state $x_i$, we can simply get $m_{ij}(x_j) \equiv \psi(x_i, x_j)$, where $\psi(x_i, x_j)$
is the constrain between unknown node i and unknown node j.

Then, expand $x_{i}$ with the information of what other unknown nodes think node i:
$$m_{ij}(x_j) \equiv \sum_{x_i} {\psi(x_i, x_j) \prod_{k \in N(x_i) \backslash j}{m_{ki}(x_i)}}$$

Gather the internal constrains between the observation and unknown node i:
$$m_{ij}(x_j) \equiv \sum_{x_i} {\phi(x_i) \psi(x_i, x_j) \prod_{k \in N(i) \backslash j}{m_{ki}(x_i)}}$$

This describes how we update the messages. Then the final probability of node i is in state $x_i$ would be(k is used for normalization):
$$b_i(x_i) \equiv k\phi(x_i)\prod_{j \in N(i)} m_{ji}(x_i)$$

\subsection{Fast Algorithm for Belief Background}
Fast algorithm of BP approximates the BP algorithm with a matrix inversion problem\cite{KoutraKKCPF11}. It uses a linear system to approach the final solution to the Belief Propagation, call it Fast BP.
Under the assumption that all probabilities are around 0.5, the approximation accuracy is quite good.
The main equation for Fast BP is the following one:
$$W\mathbf{b_h}=\mathbf{\phi_h}$$
where $W$ can be viewed as a function of the adjacency matrix of the graph, degree matrix as well as the homophily factor Then the Belief Propagation problem actually has been converted into a matrix inversion problem, computing $W^{-1}{\phi_h}$. One main limitation now for Fast BP is that it support only two classes.
