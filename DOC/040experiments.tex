 \subsection{Preliminary Experiments}
We did some preliminary experiments on BP and FastBP algorithms.

By extracting all the items, whose groups are DVD, Video and Music from the Amazon co-purchase dataset, we get 149,102 nodes and 253,407 edges connecting them.
The classify accuracy of BP is around 72\% with 5\% nodes labeled.

We then reduced the dataset to just two types (DVD and Video) of items and run FastBP on it.
The result shows that there are only 4,274 nodes have non-zero bias from 50\% probability to either type (2,298 (5\%)of them have prior value) after 10 iterations.
